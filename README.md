"Interactive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard to monitor patient inflow, waiting times, treatment outcomes, and resource utilization using Data Analytics."
# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **Emergency Room (ER) data** and building an **interactive dashboard** to monitor hospital operations.  
The goal is to track **patient inflow, waiting times, treatment outcomes, and resource utilization** in real-time to improve healthcare efficiency.  

## 🎯 Goals of the Project  
- Monitor **daily & hourly patient arrivals**  
- Analyze **average waiting and treatment times**  
- Track **common medical conditions** in ER visits  
- Evaluate **doctor & staff workload**  
- Optimize **bed and resource allocation**  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI / Tableau** → Dashboard & visualization  
- **SQL** → Data extraction and queries  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** → Data preprocessing & analysis  
- **Excel** → Initial data cleaning and storage  

## 📊 Key Dashboard Features  
- **Patient Flow Analysis** – admissions by time, age, and medical condition  
- **Wait Time Monitoring** – average waiting & treatment duration  
- **Resource Utilization** – bed availability, staff assignment  
- **Outcome Tracking** – discharge vs ICU admissions  
- **Critical Alerts** – high patient load and longer wait times  

## 📈 Outcomes & Insights  
- Identified **peak hours and days** with maximum ER load  
- Highlighted **conditions causing long treatment times**  
- Suggested **better allocation of staff & beds**  
- Improved overall **patient care efficiency**
